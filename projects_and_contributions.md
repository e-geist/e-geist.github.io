<h1>projects&contributions</h1>
<h2>personal projects</h2>
<h3>e-geist.github.io - this page</h3>
I made this page with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. It is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. 
I used the <a href="https://github.com/b2a3e8/ jekyll-theme-console">jekyll-theme-console</a> theme to make it visually appealing.
<h3>PongPing - a pong clone in HaxeFlixel</h3>
Back in university I found <a href="https://haxeflixel.com/">HaxeFlixel</a> - a 2D cross-platform game engine - and wrote this little pong clone to try it out.
Source can be found <a href="https://github.com/e-geist/PongPing">here</a>, but take it with a grain of salt because of the age and my experience at that time ;).
<h2>contributions</h2>
<h3>VideoLAN - VLC media player</h3>
I contributed some minor fixes to the Qt GUI of <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>.
This got me a mention on their <a href="https://www.videolan.org/videolan/team/">team page</a>.
